# HardcoreNationsS3

This is a Python script that I made for the Minecraft server Hardcore Nation Season 3.
It helps the owners by generating lists of players and timezone (which is a big mess).

There are not  alot of comments on this code because it is not supposed to be
understandood, but only used since I am the only one writing it.

The list in Data.py is being updated every once in a while, there are comments explaining
how the format works.

# How to use it

Go to the last line of main.py, there should be v1(), v2(), v3(), v4() or v5()
The comments above this line explains what it does and how it works.
